# AutoSwitchModelSD

Python script for generating images using a local server. The script interacts with Stable Diffusion Automatic 1111 API to automatically create images based on text prompts and change/switch models.

The script saves the generated images in the images directory with detailed filenames and text files containing image generation information.

It also uses the extension Dynamic Prompts, allowing for a wide range of customizations.
